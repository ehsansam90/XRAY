# XRAY
X-Ray analysis method with NN
This project is demonstate the simple use of CNN  network on classification problems related to image data. The goal is to simply demonstrate the possible methods due to solve related challenges. 

To begin, data sample have issue of oversampling which woulkd cause to overfitting of model. 
Data augmentation method, rotation,, brightness change,, zoom change, horizontal flip are applied to the NOT_NORMAL category of input data to solve the problem considering the nuture of input data.
